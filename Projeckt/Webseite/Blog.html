            <h2>The Journey of building a computer 11.10.2020</h2>
            <p>Introduction</p>

            <p>
                A computer is a device that has revolutionized the way the human race functions and interacts with each
                other.
                It has led to many scientific discoveries but it also serves as a means of entertainment. Traditionally
                Computers have been bought as assembled machines from retailers.
                But over the course of the years a trend has emerged where a person buys all the components and builds
                the PC themselves. This has the benefit of better upgradability, maintenance and better value.
            </p>

            <p>Part-selection</p>

            <p>
                Contrary to popular belief selecting your parts is the most difficult part of building a computer. The
                compatibility issue is non existent but the problem lies in the price to performance optimization
                and the specific needs of the user. For example a graphic designer will invest more into his graphics
                card than a musician. There are eight main components in an ordinary desktop pc and all of these are
                intertwined
                and have an effect on each other. The parts should be chosen in a balanced way in order to prevent
                bottlenecks. An example for a bottleneck is a 1200 Franc graphics card paired with a 100 Franc
                Processor.
                Due to the low end nature of the CPU (Central Processing Unit) the potential of the GPU (Graphics
                Processing Unit) cannot be utilized at all. An other point is, that you must chose between an AMD CPU
                and an Intel CPU. AMD has been the underdog for about the last decade.
                But in recent years they have caught up and some would even say that they have now surpassed Intel. Due
                to the incredible price to performance ratio that AMD offers at the moment it is pretty hard to
                recommend that someone buy intel.
                Depending on which you buy, you will have to buy a motherboard with a different Chipset and CPU-Socket.
                But other than that there are no defining compatibility issues that you have to look out for.
                So in the end, choosing you PC-Components really comes down to what you want to use the machine for.
            </p>

            <p>Building the beast</p>

            <p>
                As mentioned before, building the PC is the easier part of the process. Some compare it to Lego. The
                only exceptions being that the stakes are higher, as you might break some pretty expensive gear. But if
                you proceed carefully and follow
                the instructions you get with your components, building a computer is a piece of cake. It is simply a
                matter of connecting cables and slotting in parts. The installation of windows is also a really easy
                thing to do.
                You can download a copy of windows 10 on the microsoft website and follow the instructions provided to
                make a USB-Installer drive. Upon booting your PC will recognize the boot-drive and boot from it
                automatically.
                Follow the installation process and voila, you have successfully built a functioning PC.

            <h2>The Beginning of Tropical Trees 10.12.2020</h2>
            <br/>

            <p>
                On 02.12.2020 Tropical Trees IT Support was born, and the website is in full development now and we
                are working like mad in the background to establish ourselves.
                We also hired a new member of staff. He is a good friend of mine called Simon Wertmueller. Simon will be
                helping me out in the business,
                with the support side of things. Simon is a student in Economics and Law at a Gymnasium
                in Bern. He also has a passion for technology and really likes to help when needed ðŸ˜Š.

                This is our blog post for this month, and we look forward to posting every month with all sorts of
                topics including
                how to keep your old devices working for longer! Stay tuned on the Tropical Trees Blog.
